    "bio": "I am a software engineer and an educator who is passionate about accessibility and solving problems from a human-centered perspective. As a former middle school science teacher, I worked with a team of educators to transform traditional education into an equitable and student-centered experience. As a coding instructor, I focused on helping students' understand their code and articulate their ideas to others. My experience as an educator informs everything that I do: from adapting and adjusting plans quickly to building accessible front-end web applications and full-stack applications."
